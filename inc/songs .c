// Songs are written in this file by creating a song structure and initialization file for the song.
// You can copy and paste one of the previous structures and initializations and change the details.
// If adding songs, increase the song number. Also add the song initialization function to the 
// songListInit function at the bottom.
// To write the song, find the lowest note in the song and set that as 0 in the notes array.
// Total note range is 1 octave from Eb6 to Eb7
// For the beat length choose the shortest beat length in the song and set it as 1 then all
// the longer notes will be multiples of that.

Digital Music Box is a device that plays popular melodies while displaying graphic visuals.
This program was developed using a Tiva C connected to a Booster Pack that contained various hardware
such as a LED screen and a buzzer which is used to play the tunes.

For this project we expanded on and customized an RTOS developed by Jonathan W. Valvano, Copyright 2016

This program was written by Jonathan Arc, Abdur Aziz, and Len Shaji.
